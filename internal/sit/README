This library is a Go port of part of the "eXternal Archive Decruncher" (XAD)
Libary System by Dirk Stoecker et al.

Like the original XAD, it is licensed under the LGPL-2.1-or-later.

stuffit-test-files created by Stephan Sokolow (thank you!)

There is an unmet need for test files that use other compression algorithms.
